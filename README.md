### SCSS
* Add checkbox/download on hover effect (touch device?)
* Wait for mockup feedback to finalize button/control placement
* Add SCSS variables to make easily customizable to client brand guidelines

### JS
* Implement JSZip
* Modal
* When photos are deselected in "View Selected" they are unselected when user goes back to view all
* When photo is deselected from "View Selected", fade out?
* Hide view all when no photos are selected
