* Wait for mockup feedback to finalize button/control placement
* Add SCSS variables to make easily customizable to client brand guidelines

### JS
* JSZip (wait for DAM stuff to be finished)
* Modal/Lightbox
* Change category views (wait for DAM stuff to be finished)
* Hide view all when no photos are selected
* Lazy loading (implemented)
